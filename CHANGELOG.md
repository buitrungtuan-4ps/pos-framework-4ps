# Changelog

**Status** Accepted · **Owner** @maintainers-architecture · **Last reviewed** 2026-08-18

All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for the product and a separate `PROTOCOL_VERSION` for the cloud–edge wire format (see [`docs/naming-and-api.md`](docs/naming-and-api.md) §11).

**Rules for entries**

1. Every user-visible change gets an entry, written for the reader, not the author.
2. Categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
3. Reference the issue or pull request number.
4. Add an **Upgrade note** whenever the change affects `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, a migration, a permission identifier, or a default value.
5. Nothing is ever removed without having been deprecated for at least two releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The specification set is now in the repository: `docs/`, ADRs 0001–0012, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, the GitHub templates,
  and the frozen Vietnamese design archive.
- `LICENSE` — proprietary, internal use, as decided in ADR-0009. It was referenced by
  `README.md` and the ADR but had never been written.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — the dependency-ordered build plan from an empty repository to a pilot
  store, with an exit criterion per phase and no calendar dates.
- ADR-0013 (sans-I/O domain core, async ports, static dispatch), ADR-0014 (date, time and
  timezone library), ADR-0021 (the sixteen ports, superseding 0006), ADR-0024
  (`PROTOCOL_VERSION` negotiation), ADR-0026 (port shapes: one `PortError`,
  `Transactional`/`TxContext`, outbox cursor ordering, fault injection on the harness, and
  three corrections to ADR-0013).
- `pos-ports`: all sixteen ports from ADR-0021. `PortError` carries an AIP-193 status and the
  `PortName` that produced it, so retry policy and the error mailbox need no per-port
  translation. `Transactional` is a supertrait of `EventStore` and `ConfigStore`, so an
  adapter implementing both has exactly one transaction type and "the outbox row commits with
  the state change" is the only thing that type-checks. Object-safe mirrors
  (`DynPrinterDriver` and four others) cover the families selected by configuration rather
  than at compile time.
- `pos-contract-tests`: a shared suite per port, 104 cases in all, parameterised by a harness the
  adapter supplies. Suites are emitted by a macro that takes the adapter's own `block_on`, so this
  crate depends on no async runtime. Destructive operations — losing power, severing a link, staging
  an ambiguous card result — live on the harness rather than on the ports, so no production adapter
  ships a way to corrupt itself. A test asserts every port has a suite.
- `pos-fakes`: in-memory implementations of all sixteen ports, with fixed-capacity queues returning
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, and `tests/contract.rs` running every suite against them. `pos-core`'s tests
  will run against these fakes, so this is what stops the domain suite resting on an unchecked
  assumption about how the real store behaves.
- `pos-spec.md`: tax is per item class and keyed by sales channel, not a flat store rate;
  a table has exactly one open order; one open shift per cashier device; queue numbers
  reset daily and are not the receipt counter.
- `naming-and-api.md`: the `bills:split` and `webhook_deliveries:redeliver` custom methods.
- Cargo workspace with the three backbone crates, the pinned toolchain, layered
  lints, `deny.toml`, the `justfile`, and the `xtask` crate carrying the repository
  checks: the dependency rule, the per-crate `clippy.toml` baseline guard, action
  pinning, and internal documentation links. Each is proven to fire, not merely
  written.
- CI: a pull-request gate under ten minutes (rules, lints, tests, both build
  targets, licences, secrets, changelog), a merge-to-`main` workflow, a nightly
  advisory scan, and a daily mirror with a deletion-proof bundle.
- `pos-proto` value types, the foundation every later calculation trusts: `Ulid`
  (in-house Crockford base32, injective, time-sortable), `Money` with `Ratio`,
  `Quantity` and a single `div_round` primitive, `Timestamp`, and `BusinessDate` and
  `CalendarDate` as deliberately unconvertible types. Eighteen resource-identifier
  newtypes over `Ulid`, so a `StoreId` cannot be passed where a `TenantId` belongs.
  Fifty-six tests including property tests for the split-rounding law.
- `pos-proto` wire machinery: `Open<E>`, which degrades an unknown enum value to
  `*_UNSPECIFIED` **while retaining the original token**, plus `require()` as the
  domain boundary that refuses it; the `wire_enum!` macro; ten closed vocabularies
  (`OrderState`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentOutcome`, `ReductionKind`, …); `NoPii` as a
  sealed marker so text in an event payload is a compile error with an instruction
  attached; and the two determinism traits, `ClockSource` and `IdGenerator`.
- The event envelope, the AIP-193 error envelope with its nine canonical statuses, the
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` handshake, and the full event catalogue: **49 types**, being the 38
  the specification declares plus 11 that stated rules needed and nothing carried.
- `docs/snapshots/events.txt`, generated from the catalogue, with a CI gate that refuses
  any removal — a published event type or payload field is a contract.
- Four narrow text types (`DisplayName`, `TranslationKey`, `PermissionKey`,
  `ReleaseTag`), each admissible in an event payload for a stated reason, and
  `GuestNote`, which deliberately is not.

### Changed
- **`pos-spec.md` §18 now lists 49 event types.** The eleven additions are tabulated with
  the rule each one serves; the sharpest is `security.permission.overridden`, since a
  manager-PIN override above a discount ceiling is a named fraud control that had no
  auditable record at all.
- **`pos-spec.md` §3: a line note's text never enters the event log.** It is where "for
  Mr Nguyễn, severe peanut allergy" gets typed — a name and a health condition — and the
  log is immutable, so nothing personal in it could ever be erased. Events carry only
  whether a note exists; the kitchen reads it from the local order record.
- Every document now carries the mandatory `Status` / `Owner` / `Last reviewed` header that
  `engineering-guide.md` §12b requires.
- `architecture.md` §5 is now the authoritative port table and lists **sixteen** ports.
- `engineering-guide.md` §8's ADR index reached only 0009; it now covers every record.

### Fixed
- **The dependency rule reported crates that are never linked.** Reading
  `cargo metadata`'s resolve graph reported `log`, `defmt` and `bitflags` behind
  `jiff`, none of which this workspace activates, and reading `cargo tree` instead
  reported `syn` and `quote`, which run inside the compiler. The check now uses the
  metadata graph for structure, follows an edge only when `cargo tree` says it is
  activated, and stops at procedural macros — so the allow-list stays a statement
  about runtime dependencies rather than accumulating build-time noise. Two tests
  pin both halves.
- **`OrderIn` was missing from the port list.** ADR-0006 and `architecture.md` §5 both named
  fifteen ports and omitted it, although ADR-0012 and `pos-spec.md` §13 depend on it — it is
  the reason QR ordering reuses the marketplace intake path instead of adding a pipeline.
  ADR-0021 supersedes ADR-0006 with the corrected list.

### Upgrade notes
- Documentation and decisions only; no code, no protocol, no migrations, no permission
  changes. ADR-0006 is marked superseded rather than edited — its decision stands, only its
  port list was incomplete.
- `CODEOWNERS` routes review to four `@maintainers-*` teams. GitHub **silently ignores** an
  entry naming a team that does not exist, so the required-review protection on the backbone
  crates does nothing until those teams are created. See `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Template for a released version

```markdown
## [1.4.0] — 2026-09-01

**Product version** 1.4.0 · **Protocol version** 3 · **MSRV** 1.83
**For restaurant staff:** split bills now always add up to the original total; nothing else changes on screen.

### Added
- Seat-level ordering behind the `seats_enabled` capability flag. (#204)

### Fixed
- Rounding remainder on uneven bill splits is assigned to the final split. (#231)

### Upgrade notes
- Migration `0042_add_seat_to_order_lines` is additive; rollback to 1.3.x is safe.
- New permission `sales.order_line.assign_seat` is granted to the Server template by default.
- No protocol change; cloud 1.4.0 serves edge 1.2.x and 1.3.x.
