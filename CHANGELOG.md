**Rules for entries**

1. Every user-visible change gets an entry, written for the reader, not the author.
2. Categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
3. Reference the issue or pull request number.
4. Add an **Upgrade note** whenever the change affects `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, a migration, a permission identifier, or a default value.
5. Nothing is ever removed without having been deprecated for at least two releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The specification set is now in the repository: `docs/`, ADRs 0001–0012, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, the GitHub templates,
  and the frozen Vietnamese design archive.
- `LICENSE` — proprietary, internal use, as decided in ADR-0009. It was referenced by
  `README.md` and the ADR but had never been written.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — the dependency-ordered build plan from an empty repository to a pilot
  store, with an exit criterion per phase and no calendar dates.
- ADR-0013 (sans-I/O domain core, async ports, static dispatch), ADR-0014 (date, time and
  timezone library), ADR-0021 (the sixteen ports, superseding 0006), ADR-0024
  (`PROTOCOL_VERSION` negotiation), ADR-0026 (port shapes: one `PortError`,
  `Transactional`/`TxContext`, outbox cursor ordering, fault injection on the harness, and
  three corrections to ADR-0013).
- `pos-ports`: all sixteen ports from ADR-0021. `PortError` carries an AIP-193 status and the
  `PortName` that produced it, so retry policy and the error mailbox need no per-port
  translation. `Transactional` is a supertrait of `EventStore` and `ConfigStore`, so an
  adapter implementing both has exactly one transaction type and "the outbox row commits with
  the state change" is the only thing that type-checks. Object-safe mirrors
  (`DynPrinterDriver` and four others) cover the families selected by configuration rather
  than at compile time.
- `pos-contract-tests`: a shared suite per port, 104 cases in all, parameterised by a harness the
  adapter supplies. Suites are emitted by a macro that takes the adapter's own `block_on`, so this
  crate depends on no async runtime. Destructive operations — losing power, severing a link, staging
  an ambiguous card result — live on the harness rather than on the ports, so no production adapter
  ships a way to corrupt itself. A test asserts every port has a suite.
- `pos-fakes`: in-memory implementations of all sixteen ports, with fixed-capacity queues returning
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, and `tests/contract.rs` running every suite against them. `pos-core`'s tests
  will run against these fakes, so this is what stops the domain suite resting on an unchecked
  assumption about how the real store behaves.
- ADR-0027 and `pos-country`: a country module is a **bundle** — a `Fiscalization` implementation, a
  locale pack, tax-code format validation, a default retention period — living at `countries/<cc>/`
  rather than filed among the adapters. Selection is a Cargo feature per country, so a fork serving
  one country edits one line, deletes nothing, and compiles nothing else. `pos-proto` gained
  `CountryCode`, `TaxRate` in basis points, the channel-keyed `TaxRateTable` and `LocalePack`.
- `countries/zz/`: a reference country module that **passes the whole `Fiscalization` contract
  suite**, so a real country fills in a proven shape. `cargo xtask countries` fails a module that is
  misnamed, absent from the workspace, or wired into no binary's features.

- ADR-0025 (receipt-number authority is configuration: gapless only while one store authority is
  reachable), ADR-0028 (the real settlement invariant — `sum(applied) == total_due`, tips a separate
  ledger, cash rounding as an explicit line, tax per tax-class subtotal, service-charge taxability as
  config), and ADR-0029 (line merge: terminal states win, other fields last-writer-wins on
  `(event_time, device_id)`, commutative and associative). These resolve issues #8, #9 and #10 ahead
  of the P3 domain code they govern; `pos-spec.md` §3/§5/§14 and `architecture.md` §2/§5 are amended
  to state the rules the code will enforce.

- `pos-core` begins: the state-machine framework and the five lifecycles from `architecture.md` §5
  — Table, Order, order line, Bill, Shift. Transitions are data, enumerable at runtime, so
  `docs/state-machines.md` is generated from the code (a test keeps it in sync) and one generic
  checker proves every machine exhaustively: no reachable undefined state, no orphan or deadlocked
  state, terminal states with no exit, and a merge that is commutative, associative and
  terminal-preserving. That merge is the ADR-0029 rule — `VOIDED` outranks every editable state, so
  a concurrent edit can never resurrect a voided line — and `bill:settle` being one-time (§14.4) is
  now a property of the `Bill` machine rather than of a lock.

- `pos-core` billing: `assemble` computes a bill's totals with tax **per tax-class subtotal**
  (rounded once per class, the per-class lines reconciling to the tax total a VAT invoice prints),
  bill-level discounts and comps allocated proportionally across classes, a service charge that is
  taxable per config, and cash rounding materialised as an explicit `rounding_adjustment` line —
  ADR-0028 made mechanical. `settle` proves the settlement invariant (`sum(applied) == total_due`,
  change `= tendered − applied − tips`, tips a separate ledger) and refuses under-application and
  negative change. `split_evenly`/`split_by_weights` bind the §14.3 law (`sum(splits) ==
  original_total`) at the domain level. A `DomainError` names which rule the inputs broke. Property
  tests over arbitrary amounts, parts, weights and payments bind §14.3 and §14.5 in CI.

- `pos-core` permission registry (`pos-spec.md` §9): a **fixed catalogue** of 24 permissions declared
  through one `permissions!` macro, so a new permission is a single entry that cannot omit its group,
  risk, PIN flag, default roles or description — the enum, its `ALL`, and `Permission::meta` all
  derive from that one block and cannot drift. `PermissionSet` is a `u64` bitset (a compile-time
  assertion keeps the catalogue inside 64), roles are data synced from the cloud, and every check
  goes through one `require()` gate that is **deny by default** and returns `DomainError::PermissionDenied`
  naming the id. High-risk money vectors (void, comp, refund, price override, drawer-no-sale) carry a
  mandatory PIN flag a test enforces. `docs/snapshots/permissions.txt` records every id under the same
  removal gate as the event catalogue — the bare id is an immutable contract, the tabbed metadata is
  mutable — and `docs/permissions.md` is the generated role matrix.

### Changed
- `README.md`'s repository layout moves country modules out of `crates/adapters/` and up to
  `countries/` at the root. Filing `fiscal-vn` beside `store-sqlite` described a country as one
  implementation of one port when it is five things, and it hid the unit a fork adds or removes.
- `pos-spec.md`: tax is per item class and keyed by sales channel, not a flat store rate;
  a table has exactly one open order; one open shift per cashier device; queue numbers
  reset daily and are not the receipt counter.
- `naming-and-api.md`: the `bills:split` and `webhook_deliveries:redeliver` custom methods.
- Cargo workspace with the three backbone crates, the pinned toolchain, layered
  lints, `deny.toml`, the `justfile`, and the `xtask` crate carrying the repository
  checks: the dependency rule, the per-crate `clippy.toml` baseline guard, action
  pinning, and internal documentation links. Each is proven to fire, not merely
  written.
- CI: a pull-request gate under ten minutes (rules, lints, tests, both build
  targets, licences, secrets, changelog), a merge-to-`main` workflow, a nightly
  advisory scan, and a daily mirror with a deletion-proof bundle.
- `pos-proto` value types, the foundation every later calculation trusts: `Ulid`
  (in-house Crockford base32, injective, time-sortable), `Money` with `Ratio`,
  `Quantity` and a single `div_round` primitive, `Timestamp`, and `BusinessDate` and
  `CalendarDate` as deliberately unconvertible types. Eighteen resource-identifier
  newtypes over `Ulid`, so a `StoreId` cannot be passed where a `TenantId` belongs.
  Fifty-six tests including property tests for the split-rounding law.
- `pos-proto` wire machinery: `Open<E>`, which degrades an unknown enum value to
  `*_UNSPECIFIED` **while retaining the original token**, plus `require()` as the
  domain boundary that refuses it; the `wire_enum!` macro; ten closed vocabularies
  (`OrderState`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentOutcome`, `ReductionKind`, …); `NoPii` as a
  sealed marker so text in an event payload is a compile error with an instruction
  attached; and the two determinism traits, `ClockSource` and `IdGenerator`.
- The event envelope, the AIP-193 error envelope with its nine canonical statuses, the
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` handshake, and the full event catalogue: **49 types**, being the 38
  the specification declares plus 11 that stated rules needed and nothing carried.
- `docs/snapshots/events.txt`, generated from the catalogue, with a CI gate that refuses
  any removal — a published event type or payload field is a contract.
- Four narrow text types (`DisplayName`, `TranslationKey`, `PermissionKey`,
  `ReleaseTag`), each admissible in an event payload for a stated reason, and
  `GuestNote`, which deliberately is not.

### Changed
- **`pos-spec.md` §18 now lists 49 event types.** The eleven additions are tabulated with
  the rule each one serves; the sharpest is `security.permission.overridden`, since a
  manager-PIN override above a discount ceiling is a named fraud control that had no
  auditable record at all.
- **`pos-spec.md` §3: a line note's text never enters the event log.** It is where "for
  Mr Nguyễn, severe peanut allergy" gets typed — a name and a health condition — and the
  log is immutable, so nothing personal in it could ever be erased. Events carry only
  whether a note exists; the kitchen reads it from the local order record.
- Every document now carries the mandatory `Status` / `Owner` / `Last reviewed` header that
  `engineering-guide.md` §12b requires.
- `architecture.md` §5 is now the authoritative port table and lists **sixteen** ports.
- `engineering-guide.md` §8's ADR index reached only 0009; it now covers every record.

### Fixed
- **The dependency rule reported crates that are never linked.** Reading
  `cargo metadata`'s resolve graph reported `log`, `defmt` and `bitflags` behind
  `jiff`, none of which this workspace activates, and reading `cargo tree` instead
  reported `syn` and `quote`, which run inside the compiler. The check now uses the
  metadata graph for structure, follows an edge only when `cargo tree` says it is
  activated, and stops at procedural macros — so the allow-list stays a statement
  about runtime dependencies rather than accumulating build-time noise. Two tests
  pin both halves.
- **`OrderIn` was missing from the port list.** ADR-0006 and `architecture.md` §5 both named
  fifteen ports and omitted it, although ADR-0012 and `pos-spec.md` §13 depend on it — it is
  the reason QR ordering reuses the marketplace intake path instead of adding a pipeline.
  ADR-0021 supersedes ADR-0006 with the corrected list.

### Upgrade notes
- Documentation and decisions only; no code, no protocol, no migrations, no permission
  changes. ADR-0006 is marked superseded rather than edited — its decision stands, only its
  port list was incomplete.
- The permission catalogue introduces 24 permission identifiers (`docs/snapshots/permissions.txt`).
  This is the initial catalogue, not a change to an existing one, so nothing needs migrating; but
  from here on adding, retiring or re-defaulting a permission is an `Upgrade note` under rule 4, and a
  role synced from an older cloud that still names a retired id must keep resolving — ids are
  deprecated, never removed.
- `CODEOWNERS` routes review to four `@maintainers-*` teams. GitHub **silently ignores** an
  entry naming a team that does not exist, so the required-review protection on the backbone
  crates does nothing until those teams are created. See `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Template for a released version

```markdown
## [1.4.0] — 2026-09-01

**Product version** 1.4.0 · **Protocol version** 3 · **MSRV** 1.83
**For restaurant staff:** split bills now always add up to the original total; nothing else changes on screen.

### Added
- Seat-level ordering behind the `seats_enabled` capability flag. (#204)

### Fixed
- Rounding remainder on uneven bill splits is assigned to the final split. (#231)

### Upgrade notes
- Migration `0042_add_seat_to_order_lines` is additive; rollback to 1.3.x is safe.
- New permission `sales.order_line.assign_seat` is granted to the Server template by default.
- No protocol change; cloud 1.4.0 serves edge 1.2.x and 1.3.x.
```
